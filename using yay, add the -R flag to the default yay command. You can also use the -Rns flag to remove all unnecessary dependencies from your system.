[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
       The xdg-mime program can be used to query information about file types and to add descriptions for new file types.

[1mCOMMANDS[0m
       query
           Returns information related to file types.

           The [4mquery[24m option is for use inside a desktop session only. It is not recommended to use xdg-mime query as root.

           The following queries are supported:

           query filetype [4mFILE[24m: Returns the file type of [4mFILE[24m in the form of a MIME type.

           query default [4mmimetype[24m: Returns the default application that the desktop environment uses for opening files of type [4mmimetype[24m. The default application is
           identified by its *.desktop file.

       default
           Ask the desktop environment to make [4mapplication[24m the default application for opening files of type [4mmimetype[24m. An application can be made the default for several
           file types by specifying multiple mimetypes.

           [4mapplication[24m is the desktop file id of the application and has the form vendor-name.desktop.  [4mapplication[24m must already be installed in the desktop menu before
           it can be made the default handler. The application's desktop file must list support for all the MIME types that it wishes to be the default handler for.

           Requests to make an application a default handler may be subject to system policy or approval by the end-user. xdg-mime query can be used to verify whether an
           application is the actual default handler for a specific file type.

           The [4mdefault[24m option is for use inside a desktop session only. It is not recommended to use xdg-mime default as root.

       install
           Adds the file type descriptions provided in [4mmimetypes-file[24m to the desktop environment.  [4mmimetypes-file[24m must be a XML file that follows the freedesktop.org
           Shared MIME-info Database specification and that has a mime-info element as its document root. For each new file type one or more icons with name [4mtype[24m-[4msubtype[0m
           must be installed with the [1mxdg-icon-resource [22mcommand in the [4mmimetypes[24m context. For example the filetype application/vnd.oasis.opendocument.text requires an
           icon named application-vnd.oasis.opendocument.text to be installed (unless the file type recommends another icon name).

       uninstall
           Removes the file type descriptions provided in [4mmimetypes-file[24m and previously added with [1mxdg-mime install [22mfrom the desktop environment.  [4mmimetypes-file[24m must be
           a XML file that follows the freedesktop.org Shared MIME-info Database specification and that has a mime-info element as its document root.

[1mOPTIONS[0m
       [1m--mode [4m[22mmode[0m
           [4mmode[24m can be [4muser[24m or [4msystem[24m. In user mode the file is (un)installed for the current user only. In system mode the file is (un)installed for all users on the
           system. Usually only root is allowed to install in system mode.

           The default is to use system mode when called by root and to use user mode when called by a non-root user.

       [1m--novendor[0m
           Normally, xdg-mime checks to ensure that the [4mmimetypes-file[24m to be installed has a proper vendor prefix. This option can be used to disable that check.

           A vendor prefix consists of alpha characters ([a-zA-Z]) and is terminated with a dash ("-"). Companies and organizations are encouraged to use a word or
           phrase, preferably the organizations name, for which they hold a trademark as their vendor prefix. The purpose of the vendor prefix is to prevent name
           conflicts.

[1mENVIRONMENT VARIABLES[0m
       xdg-mime honours the following environment variables:

       XDG_UTILS_DEBUG_LEVEL
           Setting this environment variable to a non-zero numerical value makes xdg-mime do more verbose reporting on stderr. Setting a higher value increases the
           verbosity.

       XDG_UTILS_INSTALL_MODE
           This environment variable can be used by the user or administrator to override the installation mode. Valid values are [4muser[24m and [4msystem[24m.

[1mEXIT CODES[0m
       An exit code of 0 indicates success while a non-zero exit code indicates failure. The following failure codes can be returned:

       [1m1[0m
           Error in command line syntax.

       [1m2[0m
           One of the files passed on the command line did not exist.

       [1m3[0m
           A required tool could not be found.

       [1m4[0m
           The action failed.

       [1m5[0m
           No permission to read one of the files passed on the command line.

[1mEXAMPLES[0m
           xdg-mime query filetype /tmp/foobar.png

       Prints the MIME type of the file /tmp/foobar.png, in this case image/png

           xdg-mime query default image/png

       Prints the .desktop filename of the application which is registered to open PNG files.

           xdg-mime install shinythings-shiny.xml

       Adds a file type description for "shiny"-files. "shinythings-" is used as the vendor prefix. The file type description could look as follows.

           shinythings-shiny.xml:

           <?xml version="1.0"?>
           <mime-info xmlns='http://www.freedesktop.org/standards/shared-mime-info'>
             <mime-type type="text/x-shiny">
               <comment>Shiny new file type</comment>
               <glob pattern="*.shiny"/>
               <glob pattern="*.shi"/>
             </mime-type>
           </mime-info>

       An icon for this new file type must also be installed, for example with:

           xdg-icon-resource install --context mimetypes --size 64 shiny-file-icon.png text-x-shiny
